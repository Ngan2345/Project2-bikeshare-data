# Explore US Bikeshare Data

This is **Project 2** from **Udacity's Programming for Data Science with Python Nanodegree Program**.

## 1. Description

In this project, I used Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United Statesâ€”**Chicago, New York City, and Washington**.  
Bikeshare data of the three cities were provided by Udacity.  
Because the files are big, I could not upload them here, but you can access them at [(Kaggle 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/mohebmhanna/udacity-us-bikeshare-data).

## 2. Language
- Python  

## 3. How to explore the data with the code

- Download `chicago.csv`, `new_york_city.csv` and `washington.csv` files from [(Kaggle 2021)](https://www.kaggle.com/mohebmhanna/udacity-us-bikeshare-data) and store them in the same folder as `bikeshare.py` file
- Input `python bikeshare.py` on your terminal to run this program
- Follow the instruction by choosing the city, the month and the day of the week
- You can then access the information about _**the most frequent time of travel, the most popular station and trip, total and average duration of all trips and users's general information**_.
- Note that to see the most popular month and day of the week that users generally use the bike, type `all` for your month and day of the week choice.  
Otherwise if you would like the choose the most common day of the week for a specific month, type the name of the month and `all` for the day of the week.

## 4. Reference
I have applied Udacity's Project Instruction Solution 1,2,3 to my assignment.  
My `#def display_data` code is based on [(StackOverFlow 2020)](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65480967/how-can-i-display-five-rows-of-data-based-on-user-in-python).
